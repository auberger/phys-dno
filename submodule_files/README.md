# SKEL Integration for Physics-DNO

This folder contains utilities for integrating the SKEL (Skinned Kinematic Estimation of Limbs) model with Physics-DNO to create anatomically accurate skeletal animations from motion data.

The SKEL repo should be cloned into external/ and the files in this folder should be copied into SKEL/skel/
